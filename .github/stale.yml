markComment: >
  <p>This issue has been marked as stale and will be automatically closed. 
  This happened because:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>It has been inactive for the past year.</li>
    <li>It isn't in a project or a milestone.</li>
    <li>It hasn’t been labeled `[Pri] Blocker`, `[Pri] High`, or `good first issue`.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>However, discussion is still welcome! If the issue is still valid, 
  please leave a comment with a brief explanation so the issue can
  be reopened.</p>
