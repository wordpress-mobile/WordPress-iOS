# Contributing to WordPress-iOS

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to the app, we really appreciate it.

There are many ways to contribute – reporting bugs, feature suggestions, fixing bugs, submitting pull requests for enhancements.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues), that’s all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, "Feature Request:", or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the part of the app that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.  A screenshot is always helpful as well.

## Submitting code changes

We welcome Pull Requests for bug fixes on any open issues that you'd like to contribute!  More details on our process can be found in the [Make WordPress Mobile handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/pathways/ios/), specifically [here](https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/pathways/ios/how-to-contribute/).

## Discussion

Aside from writing issues and pull requests, you can also hang out in the #mobile WordPress.org Slack channel with other WordPress Mobile developers/contributors. Check out chat.wordpress.org for instructions on how to create an account in Slack.

The purpose of the Slack chat is to provide updates about ongoing initiatives regarding the mobile apps and to discuss, prioritize and coordinate future changes. If you have questions, Slack chat is a great place to start.

## Contribute to translations

We use a tool called GlotPress to manage translations. The WordPress-iOS GlotPress instance lives here: http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/apps/ios/dev. To add new translations or fix existing ones, create an account over at GlotPress and submit your changes over at the GlotPress site.
