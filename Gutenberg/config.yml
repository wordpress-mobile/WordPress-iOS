  # This should have either a commit or tag key.
  # If both are set, tag will take precedence.

  # We have automation that reads and updates this file.
  # Leaving commented keys is discouraged, because as the automation would ignore them and the resulting updates would be noisy
  # If you want to use a local version, please use the LOCAL_GUTENBERG environment variable when calling CocoaPods.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   LOCAL_GUTENBERG=../my-gutenberg-fork bundle exec pod install
