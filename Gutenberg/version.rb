# This file isolates the definition of which version of Gutenberg to use.

# Either use commit or tag, if both are left uncommented, tag will take precedence.

# If you want to use a local version, please use the LOCAL_GUTENBERG environment variable when calling CocoaPods.
#
# Example:
#
#   LOCAL_GUTENBERG=../my-gutenberg-fork bundle exec pod install

  # commit: '',
  tag: 'v1.96.0'
