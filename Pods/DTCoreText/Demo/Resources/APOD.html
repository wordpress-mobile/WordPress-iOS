In reddish hues, image data from the large
<a href="ap091016.html">Herschel infrared</a>
observatory traces enormous lanes of dust,
warmed by stars, sweeping along Andromeda's spiral arms.

The dust, in conjunction with the galaxy's interstellar gas,
comprises the raw material for future
<a href="ap101022.html">star formation</a>.

X-ray data from the <a href="ap040130.html">XMM-Newton</a>
observatory in blue
pinpoint Andromeda's <a href="ap000121.html">X-ray binary</a>
star systems.

These systems likely contain neutron stars or stellar mass
black holes that represent final stages in stellar evolution.

More than twice the size of our <a href="ap080606.html">own Milky Way</a>,
the Andromeda Galaxy is over 200,000 light-years across.</p>
