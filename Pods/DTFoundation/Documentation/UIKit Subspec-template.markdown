## Categories

A collection of category extensions for `NSURL` that provide direct access to built-in app capabilities.

### UIApplication (DTNetworkActivity)

Enhancement for `UIApplication` to properly count active network sessions and show the network activity indicator whenever there are more than 0 active sessions.
 
### UIImage (DTFoundation)

Methods to help with working with images.

### UIView (DTFoundation)

Enhancements for `UIView`.

### UIWebView (DTFoundation)

Some convenient functions that can be also achieved if you know JavaScript, but are way more easy to remember like this.
