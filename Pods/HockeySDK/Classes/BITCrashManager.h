/**
 The crash reporting module.
 
 This is the HockeySDK module for handling crash reports, including when distributed via the App Store.
 As a foundation it is using the open source, reliable and async-safe crash reporting framework
 [PLCrashReporter](https://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter/).
 
 This module works as a wrapper around the underlying crash reporting framework and provides functionality to
 detect new crashes, queues them if networking is not available, present a user interface to approve sending
 the reports to the HockeyApp servers and more.
 
 It also provides options to add additional meta information to each crash report, like `userName`, `userEmail`
 via `BITHockeyManagerDelegate` protocol, and additional textual log information via `BITCrashManagerDelegate`
 protocol and a way to detect startup crashes so you can adjust your startup process to get these crash reports
 too and delay your app initialization.
 
 Crashes are send the next time the app starts. If `crashManagerStatus` is set to `BITCrashManagerStatusAutoSend`,
 crashes will be send without any user interaction, otherwise an alert will appear allowing the users to decide
 whether they want to send the report or not. This module is not sending the reports right when the crash happens
 deliberately, because if is not safe to implement such a mechanism while being async-safe (any Objective-C code
 is _NOT_ async-safe!) and not causing more danger like a deadlock of the device, than helping. We found that users
 do start the app again because most don't know what happened, and you will get by far most of the reports.
 
 Sending the reports on startup is done asynchronously (non-blocking). This is the only safe way to ensure
 that the app won't be possibly killed by the iOS watchdog process, because startup could take too long
 and the app could not react to any user input when network conditions are bad or connectivity might be
 very slow.
 
 It is possible to check upon startup if the app crashed before using `didCrashInLastSession` and also how much
 time passed between the app launch and the crash using `timeintervalCrashInLastSessionOccured`. This allows you
 to add additional code to your app delaying the app start until the crash has been successfully send if the crash
 occured within a critical startup timeframe, e.g. after 10 seconds. The `BITCrashManagerDelegate` protocol provides
 various delegates to inform the app about it's current status so you can continue the remaining app startup setup
 after sending has been completed. The documentation contains a guide
 [How to handle Crashes on startup](HowTo-Handle-Crashes-On-Startup) with an example on how to do that.
 
 More background information on this topic can be found in the following blog post by Landon Fuller, the
 developer of [PLCrashReporter](https://www.plcrashreporter.org), about writing reliable and
 safe crash reporting: [Reliable Crash Reporting](http://goo.gl/WvTBR)
 
 @warning If you start the app with the Xcode debugger attached, detecting crashes will _NOT_ be enabled!
