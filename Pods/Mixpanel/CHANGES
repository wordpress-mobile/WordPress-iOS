Changes with version 2.0.0                                         25 Apr 2013

    * New [mixpanel identify:], removed [mixpanel.people identify:]. 

        IMPORTANT: We used to have a separate [mixpanel.people identify:]
        method. You had to call it before we'd flush people records. It's gone
        (hence incrementing the major version number for this release). The new
        behavior is this: events will go right away with default distinct ID.
        People records will be queued until identify: is called. At that point
        the distinct ID used in identify: is used for both events and people
        records. if you want to use the default ID for people, use [mixpanel
        identify:mixpanel.distinctId];

    * Distinct ID defaults to iOS IFA for iOS 6+ and falls back to ODIN1

    * New automatic properties:
        
        $app_release and $ios_app_release (for Engagement and People,
        respectively) which are CFBundleShortVersionString. Note: old
        $ios_app_version remains for backward compatibility.

        $ios_ifa 

    * Added setOnce:

    * Added unregisterSuperProperty:
