[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone.svg?branch=yolo-travis-ci)](https://travis-ci.org/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone)

**Quick start**

1. Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) with `gem install cocoapods`.
2. Create a file in your XCode project called `Podfile` and add the following line:

```ruby
pod 'Mixpanel'
```

3. Run `pod install` in your xcode project directory. CocoaPods should download and
install the Mixpanel library, and create a new Xcode workspace. Open up this workspace in Xcode.
4. Add the following to your `AppDelegate.m`:

```objc
#import <Mixpanel/Mixpanel.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [Mixpanel sharedInstanceWithToken:MIXPANEL_TOKEN];
}
```

5. Start tracking actions in your app:

```objc
[[Mixpanel sharedInstance] track:@"Watched video" properties:@{@"duration": @53}];
```
