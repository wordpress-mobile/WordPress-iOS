Listing of notable changes by release. More detail is usually found in the Git 
commit messages and/or the pull requests.

OCMock 3.0 (2013-06-12)

* Added macro for verify with delay
* Fixed several critical bugs
* Allowing nil as block in stub action. With partial mocks this makes it 
  possible to overwrite a method to do nothing (Sam Stigler) 
* More descriptive messages when trying to verify unknown method


OCMock 3.0.M3 (2014-05-31)

* Changed license to Apache 2 license
* Added support for verify-after-run for class methods and for methods sent 
  directly to the real object covered by a partial mock.
* Using a temporary meta class subclass for mocking class methods, enabling
  full clean-up. As a consequence class methods mocked on a given class are no 
  longer mocked in all subclasses. 
* Throwing descriptive exception when attempting to create partial mock on
  toll-free bridged classes and tagged pointers (Mark Larsen)	


OCMock 3.0.M2 (2014-05-07)

* Added support from verify-after-run. Only works for methods that are sent
  to a mock object. Does not work for classes and methods sent directly to 
  the real object covered by a partial mock.
* Failures without location are now thrown as OCMockTestFailure exception, 
  not as NSInternalInconsistencyException


OCMock 3.0.M1 (2014-04-26)

* Added macros for modern syntax
* Automatic deregistration of observer mocks




OCMock 2.2.4 (2014-04-04)

2014-04-05

* Switched unit test for OCMock itself to XCTest.
* Added andForwardToRealObject support for class methods (Carl Lindberg)
* Extended OCMockObject with verifyWithDelay (Charles Harley, Daniel
  Doubrovkine)


OCMock 2.2.2 (2013-12-19)

* Added implementation for Apple-interal NSIsKind informal protocol (Brian 
  Gerstle)
* Various fixes for method with structure returns (Carl Lindberg)
* Added a specially typed method for object references to OCMArg.
* Fixed bug that caused matching to be aborted on first ignored non-object arg.
* Fixed a bug where partial mocks wouldn't clean up mocked class methods.
  (we7teck)
* Improved value macro so it can take constant arguments and expressions. (Carl
  Lindberg)
* Fixed a bug that caused crashes when methods that require "special" struct
  returns were mocked in partial mocks. (Carl Lindberg)


OCMock 2.2.1 (2013-07-24)

* Fixed several bugs regarding class method mocking in class hierarchies.
* Fixed bug preventing the same class method to be expected more than once.


OCMock 2.2 (2013-07-02)

* Can ignore non-object arguments on a per-invocation basis.
* Added constraint for any selector.


OCMock 2.1.2 (2013-06-19)

* Constraints implement NSCopying for OS X 10.9 SDK compatibility.


OCMock 2.1 (2013-03-15)

* Stubbing an object creation method now handles retain count correctly.
* Added support for forwardingTagetForSelector: (thanks to Jeff Watkins)
* Added class method mocking capability to class mock objects
* Added implementation of isKindOfClass: to class mock objects
* Allowing to set non-object pass-by-ref args (thanks to Glenn L. Austin)
* Calling a previously expected method on a partial mock is no longer an error.


OCMock 2.0 (2012-03-02)

* Avoiding deprecated method to convert to a C string (thanks to Kushal
  Pisavadia)
* Recreated project from scratch with new conventions in Xcode 4.2 (thanks to
  Matt Di Pasquale)
* Arguments only need to be equal, don't have to have same class

  Marco Sandrini)
* Fix to allow block arguments (thanks to Justin DeWind)

* Partial mocks are now deallocated as they should

* Added support for calling arbitrary methods when stubbed methods are invoked.
* Added support for posting notifications (based on Jean-Francois Dontigny's
  code)
* Fixed bug around complex type encodings (Jean-Francois Dontigny)
* Partial mocks now work on object reference and self (thanks to Mike Mangino)
* Added partial mocks (calls to the original object reference cannot be mocked)


OCMock 1.42 (2009-05-19)

* Mock observers now handle user infos on notifications.
* Added inital support for mock observers (loosely based on Dave Dribbin's idea)
* Moved factory methods from OCMConstraint to OCMArg
* Added pass by ref argument setters
* Linked install name now uses @rpath (Dave Dribbin)

OCMock 1.29 (2008-07-07)

* Resetting invocation target in recorder to avoid retain cycles.
* Added optional integration with hamcrest for constraints
* Now building quad-fat; the 64-bit versions are somewhat experimental though
* Using new functions to deal with protocols (Evan Doll)
* Added support for void* parameters (Tuukka Norri)

* Added a simple constraint implementation.


OCMock 1.17 (2007-06-04)

  when verify is called; in case the first throw is ignored by a framework.

  object (Jeremy Higgs)
