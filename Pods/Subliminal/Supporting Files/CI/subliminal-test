\`subliminal-test\` builds a scheme contained in an Xcode project or Xcode workspace,
then tests the product using Subliminal.

\`subliminal-test\` returns failure in the following conditions, as indicated by their error codes:

  * 1 - the tests did not finish
  * 2 - one or more tests failed
  * 3 - the tests ran in a focused state (see \`+[SLTest isFocused]\`), because then only a subset of tests may have run
  * 4 - the tests ran using a predetermined seed (see \`-[SLTestController runTests:usingSeed:withCompletionBlock:]\`),
  	because the predetermined test order may have masked test pollution

Otherwise, \`subliminal-test\` returns success (0).

\`subliminal-test\` expects to be run:

  * alongside the other scripts that were originally in \`/Supporting Files/CI\`;
  * with Subliminal having been installed on the test machine, using \`rake install DOCS=no\`;
  * and with \`instruments\` having been \"pre-authorized\" to take control of the application,
  	as described here: https://github.com/inkling/Subliminal/wiki/Continuous-Integration#faq.

Also make sure that your \"Integration Tests\" scheme is shared (in Xcode, click \`Product -> Schemes -> Manage Schemesâ€¦\`
and then click the \"Shared\" checkbox next to the scheme) and checked into source control:
the server will not be able to autocreate the scheme, as you may have done locally.

Required arguments:
	-project <project_path>		Build the project at the specified path.
					Either this or \`-workspace\` must be specified.

	-workspace <workspace_path>	Build the workspace at the specified path.
					Either this or \`-project\` must be specified.

	-sim_device <device_type>	The type of device to simulate.
					Acceptable values are listed by executing \`instruments -s devices\`:
					given a listing like \"iPad - Simulator - iOS 7.1\", the device
					type is the first dash-separated component, trimmed of spaces,
					e.g. \"iPad\".

					Note that (despite the response of \`instruments -s devices\`)
					the iOS Simulator does not accept certain combinations 
					of device type and SDK (as specified using the \`-sim_version\`
					argument), e.g. \"iPhone\" and \"7.1\".

					Either this or \`-hw_id\` must be specified.

	-hw_id <udid>			The UDID of the hardware to target.
					Either this or \`-sim_device\` must be specified.

Optional build arguments:
	-build_tool <tool_name>		The tool to use to build the scheme. Should be either \"xcrun xcodebuild\" 
					or \"xctool\". Defaults to \"xcrun xcodebuild\".

	-scheme <scheme_name>		The scheme to use to build the specified project or workspace.
					Defaults to \"Integration Tests\".

	-configuration <configuration>	The configuration to use to build the target specified by \`-scheme\`.
					Defaults to \"Release\".

	-sdk <sdk>			The SDK to use to build the specified project or workspace.
					This should be an iOS Simulator SDK if \`-sim_device\` is specified, 
					or an iOS device SDK if \`-hw_id\` is specified. Defaults to 
					\"iphonesimulator\" (the latest iOS Simulator SDK installed) 
					if \`-sim_device\` is specified, or \"iphoneos\" (the latest 
					iOS device SDK) if \`-hw_id\` is specified.

	-replacement_bundle_id <id>	The identifier to use to overwrite the product's bundle identifier.
					When testing in-app purchase, this must be the identifier of your main app.
					
					This option should only be used when testing in the Simulator,
					because two applications with the same identifier cannot be installed simultaneously, 
					and devices cannot be programmatically reset. If this is set and tests are running 
					in the Simulator, the Simulator will be reset after testing 
					to avoid collisions on subsequent runs.

	--quiet_build			If specified, the script will only log build output to the console 
					if the build fails. Builds may be made less verbose, without hiding 
					log output entirely, by using \`xctool\` as a build tool.

Optional testing arguments:
	-sim_version <version>		The version of the iOS Simulator SDK to test with, 
					e.g. 6.1 or 7.1. Defaults to the latest iOS Simulator SDK 
					installed. Ignored if \`-sim_device\` is not specified.

					Note that the iOS Simulator does not accept certain combinations 
					of device type and SDK, e.g. \"iPhone\" and \"7.1\".

	-timeout <timeout>		The maximum duration for which to run the tests before aborting.
					Specified in milliseconds and as a number rather than a string. Defaults to infinite.

	-output <output_dir>		The directory to which to save Instruments' output, to aid in debugging test failures:

					  * the run log, as an XML \`.plist\`;
					  * screenshots taken when warnings or errors are logged;
					  * and the run's \`.trace\` file, which can be opened in the Instruments GUI to view the run log and the screenshots.

					Has no default value.

	--verbose_logging		Enables UIAutomation's debug logs, which record every user interaction simulated 
					by the Automation instrument. 

	-e <variable> <value>		An environment variable setting. You may specify more than one.
