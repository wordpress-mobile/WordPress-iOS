#import "GTMHTTPFetcher.h"

// GTM HTTP Logging
//
// All traffic using GTMHTTPFetcher can be easily logged.  Call
//
//   [GTMHTTPFetcher setLoggingEnabled:YES];
//
// to begin generating log files.
//
// Log files are put into a folder on the desktop called "GTMHTTPDebugLogs"
// unless another directory is specified with +setLoggingDirectory.
//
// In the iPhone simulator, the default logs location is the user's home
// directory in ~/Library/Application Support.  On the iPhone device, the
// default logs location is the application's documents directory on the device.
//
// Tip: use the Finder's "Sort By Date" to find the most recent logs.
//
// Each run of an application gets a separate set of log files.  An html
// file is generated to simplify browsing the run's http transactions.
// The html file includes javascript links for inline viewing of uploaded
// and downloaded data.
//
// A symlink is created in the logs folder to simplify finding the html file
// for the latest run of the application; the symlink is called
//
//   AppName_http_log_newest.html
//
// For better viewing of XML logs, use Camino or Firefox rather than Safari.
//
// Each fetcher may be given a comment to be inserted as a label in the logs,
// such as
//   [fetcher setCommentWithFormat:@"retrieve item %@", itemName];
//
// Projects may define STRIP_GTM_FETCH_LOGGING to remove logging code.
