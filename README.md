## Building

Starting with changeset 3633 version 3.2, WordPress for iOS uses Cocoapods (http://cocoapods.org/) to manage third party libraries.  Trying to build the project by itself (WordPress.xcproj) after launching will result in an error, as the resources managed by cocoapods are not included.  Instead, launch the workspace by either double clicking on WordPress.xcworkspace file, or launch Xcode and choose File > Open and browse to WordPress.xcworkspace. 

You will not be able to connect to WordPress.com hosted blogs when compiling WordPress for iOS yourself.  See the following handbook page for more information: http://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/general-guides/connecting-to-wordpress-com/
