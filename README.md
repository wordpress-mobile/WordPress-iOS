## Building

### Cocoapods

Starting with changeset 3633 version 3.2, WordPress for iOS uses Cocoapods (http://cocoapods.org/) to manage third party libraries.  Trying to build the project by itself (WordPress.xcproj) after launching will result in an error, as the resources managed by cocoapods are not included.

Run `pod install` from the command line to install dependencies for the project.

*The current version of CocoaPods is recommended.*

### SwiftLint

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce a common style for Swift code. Xcode will show a warning if you don't have it installed. The app should build and work without it, but if you plan to write code, you are encouraged to install it. No commit should have lint warnings or errors. To install SwiftLint, you can run `Scripts/install-swiftlint.sh`.

If your code has any style violations, you can try to automatically correct them by running `./build-tools/swiftlint/bin/swiftlint autocorrect`. Otherwise you have to fix them manually.

### Xcode

Launch the workspace by either double clicking on WordPress.xcworkspace file, or launch Xcode and choose File > Open and browse to WordPress.xcworkspace.

*WordPress for iOS requires Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7.0 or newer. Previous versions of Xcode can be [downloaded from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action).*

More information on building the project and the tools required can be found in [the handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/pathways/ios/tools-requirements/).

## Logging in

In order to login to a WordPress.com account, you will need to create an account over at https://developer.wordpress.com. The only account you will be able to login in with is the one affiliated with your developer account. Once you have an account and a corresponding app id and app secret, you will need to setup a ~/.wpcom_app_credentials file as detailed [here](http://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/pathways/ios/tutorials-guides/#3-%c2%a0setup-wpcom_app_credentials). For more details see http://developer.wordpress.com/2014/07/04/authentication-improvements-for-testing-your-apps/.
