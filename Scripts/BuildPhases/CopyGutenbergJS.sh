# CocoaPods fetches Gutenberg in two possible ways: XCFramework and source.
#
# We check first for the XCFramework setup, fallingback to source only if that is not there.
#
# Because the XCFramework location is in `PODS_XCFRAMEWORKS_BUILD_DIR`, it will only appear if CocoaPods use XCFrameworks.
# This makes the setup robust against having both a copy of the XCFramework and of the Gutenberg source code in the Pods folder.
