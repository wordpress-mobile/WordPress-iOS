Take a peek at what’s new in this release:

- Support for full-width and wide alignment for the Group, Cover, and Image blocks (with support for more blocks to come).
- Love rounded corners on your images? We’ve also added support for the Rounded style in the Image block.
- Some people may have experienced a misbehaving toolbar when adding a new block, but we’ve fixed this issue.
- We also noticed that in Image Preview, images were not positioned correctly after changing device orientation, but this has been addressed, too.
- We resolved a few other issues around signup and login, including a username display issue after signing up with Apple, and an incorrect error message that displayed when you reach a maximum number of failed login attempts.
