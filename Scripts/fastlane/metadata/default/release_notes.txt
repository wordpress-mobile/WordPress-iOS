For this release, we’ve smoothed out the experience in a few more areas:

- Added support for password autofill when entering a username during login.
- Added clarification text about empty messages when sharing posts to social media. If you don’t provide a message, we’ll use the post title by default.
- We now automatically save your draft before showing you a preview.
- Fixed an issue causing big spaces on top of (or below) some images in Reader.
- Fixed an indentation bug in the Pages list for private pages.
- Fixed a visual bug affecting the Posts list at large text sizes.
