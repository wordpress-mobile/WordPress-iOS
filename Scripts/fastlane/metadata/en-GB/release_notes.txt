- Block editor: we’ve added a “media & text” block! The link target (open in new tab) option has been added to image block settings. We fixed a bug where the “new photo post” shortcut didn’t add the selected photo.
- Stats: you can now customise insights. Insight loading on slow networks is faster.
- Dark mode: improvements and small bug fixes all over the app.
