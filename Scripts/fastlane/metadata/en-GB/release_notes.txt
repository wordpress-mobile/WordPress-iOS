- With this update, you can internet without the actual internet. Edit and save posts while you’re offline, we’ll automatically upload (or publish) them when your device is back online.
- Sometimes, the “Me” view would be blank if you logged in with a self-hosted site, which is both (1) a bug and (2) not great for anyone’s self-esteem. That’s fixed, so Me is you again.
- Sometimes updating a pending post caused the post to be published. All actions starting with P have been straightened out, and that won’t happen anymore – pending posts will remaining pending until you say otherwise.
- And finally, more block editor improvements — it supports image alignment options now.
