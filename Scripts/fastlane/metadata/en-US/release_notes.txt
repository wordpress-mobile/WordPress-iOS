It’s a fact: GIFs make the internet better. You now have access to a library of free GIFs, via Tenor, to add to any post or page using an Image block. You’ll even see the animation right in the editor as you’re creating!

The Block editor has another batch of improvements:
– Support for theme-defined colors and gradients in the Cover block,
– Ability to upload videos to Cover blocks, even if the editor is closed.
– And our favorite update: improvement to caption and citation handling. Press enter after adding a caption in an Image, Video, Gallery, Quote, or Pullquote block, and you’ll automatically find yourself in a new block.

Along with those updates, you can now choose which pages to use as your homepage and posts page right from the Pages list, and there’s app-level toggle for choosing between light or dark appearance.

We know that the Latest Post date was being calculated incorrectly on the Insights page. That’s fixed!

A few issues with Quick Start tours were making them slightly less quick. We fixed up some flow issues in the “Grow Your Audience” and “Publish a Post” tours, and squashed a bug that stopped VoiceOver users from getting updates about completed Quick Start tasks. (And VoiceOver users: the Next Steps section now supports VoiceOver, too.)
