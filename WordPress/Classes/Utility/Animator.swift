/// Animator is a helper to build responsive animations.
///
/// The main benefit of this class are the preamble and cleanup blocks, which
/// are only called before/after all the animations.
///
/// You should keep a reference to the animator object, and use the same
/// animator for related animations.
///
/// A very simple example of preamble and cleanup:
///
///     class MyViewController: UIViewController {
///         lazy var animator = Animator()
///         var showError: Bool = false {
///             didSet {
///                 animator.animateWithDuration(0.3,
///                     preamble: { [unowned self] in
///                         if self.showError {
///                             let view = self.createErrorView()
///                             self.view.addSubview(view)
///                             self.errorView = view
///                             self.errorView?.alpha = 0
///                         }
///                     }, animations: { [unowned self] in
///                         self.errorView?.alpha = 1
///                     }, cleanup: { [unowned self] in
///                         if !self.showError {
///                             self.errorView?.removeFromSuperview()
///                             self.errorView = nil
///                         }
///                     })
///             }
///         }
///
///         func createErrorView() -> UIView {
///             // Create the error view
///         }
///         var errorView: UIView? = nil
///     }
