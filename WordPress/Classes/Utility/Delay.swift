/// A delayed action implemented using GCD
///
/// This class will perform the given action after the given delay, unless it is
/// canceled first.
///
/// - Example: Create an action and cancel it.
///
///     // Print "action" after 5 seconds
///     let action = DispatchDelayedAction(delay: 5) { print("action") }
///     // Actually, cancel
///     action.cancel()
///
struct DispatchDelayedAction {
    // The whole dance with the cancellation type might seem pointless. After
    // all, why not use a Bool instead?
    //
    // The goal is to have a simple to use API, but one that allows
    // cancellation.  So you could do something as simple as:
    //
    //     DispatchDelayedAction(delay: 5) { doSomething() }
    //
    // Any of the Timer-based approaches would require keeping a reference to
    // self, and even then, the cleaner block-based approach is iOS 10 only.
    //
    // For a GCD-based approach, we can just store a canceled flag and prevent
    // the action from happening. But this would require doing some non-obvious
    // weak self dance as well. We'd want to capture self weakly, and only
    // perform the action if self?.canceled is false or self is nil.
    //
    // The alternative is to capture a class that contains the cancellation
    // status instead of self. If we want to keep a reference to self and cancel
    // that's fine, if we don't the asyncAfter block will capture the
    // cancellation class instance and release it after it completes.
