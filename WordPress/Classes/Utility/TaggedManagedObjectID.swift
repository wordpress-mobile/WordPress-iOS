/// `TaggedManagedObjectID` is an `NSManagedObjectID` wrapper that also contains the model type of the `NSManagedObjectID`.
///
/// By using this strongly typed `NSManagedObjectID`, we can declare APIs that are bound to specific model types, thus
/// preventing an incorrect object id being used as argument.
///
/// Take the following function as an example,
/// ```
/// func getPost(fromBlogID blogID: NSManagedObjectID)
/// ```
///
/// We can call the function with any `NSManagedObjectID`: `getPost(fromBlogID: themeObjectID)`. This usage is obviously
/// incorrect, but we won't be able to catch this error until something goes wrong at rumtime.
///
/// However, we can change the declaration to
/// ```
/// func getPost(fromBlogID: TaggedManagedObjectID<Blog>)
/// ```
///
/// Now the type `Blog` is built into the function signature, and the Swift compiler would report an error if we call it
/// using `getPost(fromBlogID: themeObjectID)`.
///
/// The type name is inspired by the swift-tagged library. The reason we don't use that library is the library exposes
/// a public initliaser `init(rawValue:)` which is not what we want. With this public initialiser available for all users,
/// we can't perform the validation described in `init(objectID:)`.
