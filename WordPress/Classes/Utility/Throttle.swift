/// This class provides an easy way to ensure that an operation won't happen more than once in the specified
/// amount of seconds.
/// A common use case is when performing an online search, to limit the number of requests made to the backend as well
/// as the number of (possibly stale) UI updates as the user types.
///
/// Note:
/// Any new block passed to `throttle(:_)` cancels the previous one. If you need to throttle multiple things
/// (i.e. online search and unrelated background refresh), you'll need to have a separate `Throttle` for each of them.
