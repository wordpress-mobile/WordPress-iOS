We made some big changes to the block editor, including styles, colors, and icons. You’ll also find more buttons and block options in the header toolbar, including the undo and redo buttons. That’s right, you now have more tools than Batman’s utility belt.

While we were at it, we plugged a few memory leaks, improved posting activity stats, and solved an issue where the app wouldn’t work for some users after opening.

We also fixed several crashes caused by tapping blogging prompts, following sites in the Reader, and deleting the WordPress app after a successful migration.
