Welcome to version 21! In honor of the occasion, we added extensions so you can save content as a draft and share content to Jetpack using your device’s built-in menus. You’ll also get more detailed push notifications on your device.

We updated the app’s launch screen with a simple, sleek design and made some user-friendly design upgrades to the Comment Details view. You can also change your Jetpack app icon using a range of colorful options in the App Settings menu.

Finally, we fixed a handful of bugs.

- Publish text won’t appear when you’re working on a Post or Page in landscape mode, only portrait. No more keyboard overlap.
- Cached notifications no longer appear on screen after you log out of your WordPress.com account.
- We investigated the case of the vanishing navigation bar during the Login process. It now stays visible from start to finish. Mystery solved.
