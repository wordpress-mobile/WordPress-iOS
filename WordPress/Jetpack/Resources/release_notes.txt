With 17.6, you can add the Audio Block to any WordPress.com site, whatever plan you’re on – including the Free Plan. The Audio Block makes it easy to add podcasts, music, and sound files to your posts and pages.

We’ve been hard at work wrangling UX improvements, too:

When you assign a parent page to a page without a title, you’ll now see a ‘(no title)’ placeholder instead of a blank line, giving you a gentle nudge to name the page.

You’ve never been able to edit Post Archive pages because they’re automatically generated. In 17.6, you won’t be able to open them in the editor, either, saving you a wasted trip.

We’ve also been working on fixing things:

We took care of some notices that had been overlapping the ActionSheet, including one that displays Site Icon controls, another displaying the QuickStart Removal, and a third that displays More Actions in the editor.

Last up, we squashed a bug that sometimes caused the app to crash during comment moderation and another to fix a login error for WordPress.org sites to show inline.

That’s all for 17.6. See you in 17.7!
