Find out how your content is performing with our changes to Stats Insights and learn what types of content your readers like to see.

We also fixed a few issues in various areas of the app.

- The “No media matching your search” message in the Media Picker now appears in the right spot. Home, sweet home.
- Some users were getting stuck on the “What would you like to focus on first?” screen after logging in, but no more—focus away, friends.
- You’ll no longer skip to the end of the migration flow if you close the app while migrating your site content from WordPress to Jetpack. We made some design adjustments to the final migration screen, too.
- Pull-to-refresh properly updates your follower stats on the Total Followers Details screen. 10/10, would pull again.
