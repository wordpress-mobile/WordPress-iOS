Hot news—Jetpack now supports Blaze, so you can reach new readers by promoting a post or page from within the app.

We’ve added a little extra support for sites with individual plugins. These plugins don’t support all app features yet, but you can always install the full Jetpack plugin instead. Ready to launch?

We also added a post-migration FAQ card to the Help screen, which you’ll see after switching from the WordPress app over to Jetpack.

Finally, there’s a new button to the Post menu that lets you block an author so their posts no longer appear in your content feed.
