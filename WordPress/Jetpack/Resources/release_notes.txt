We fixed an issue with the home screen’s “Work on a draft post” card. The app will no longer crash when you access drafts while they’re in the middle of uploading.

We also solved a couple of problems in the block editor.

- Right on—image blocks now display the correct aspect ratio, whether or not the image has a set width and height.
- When you’re dictating text, the cursor’s position will stay where it’s supposed to—no more jumping around. Keep calm and dictate on.
