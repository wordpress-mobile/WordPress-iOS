We added cards to your dashboard. The Activity Log card shows your three most recent activities, and the Pages card shows the last three pages you modified.

We also made some important changes in the block editor. To prevent an app crash, deleted and undefined reusable blocks can no longer be converted to regular blocks.

When you tap on a nested text block, you can immediately edit content in that block—no more tapping through every nesting level to get where you want to go. (Our fingers were getting tired, too.)

Speaking of reusable blocks—we updated the “editing not supported” message to remove the mention of WordPress. We know what app we’re using, we promise.

Finally, we fixed a bug where the app would crash if you tried to upload media to a classic block without giving WordPress access to your device’s media library. Instead, you’ll see a prompt asking for media access. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
