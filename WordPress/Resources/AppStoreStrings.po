"Manage or create your WordPress blog or website right from your iOS device: create and edit posts and pages, upload your favorite photos and videos, view stats and reply to comments.\n"
"\n"
"With WordPress for iOS, you have the power to publish in the palm of your hand. Draft a spontaneous haiku from the couch. Snap and post a photo on your lunch break. Respond to your latest comments, or check your stats to see what new countries today’s visitors are coming from.\n"
"\n"
"WordPress for iOS is an Open Source project, which means you too can contribute to its development. Learn more at https://apps.wordpress.com/contribute/.\n"
"\n"
"WordPress for iOS supports WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress.org sites running WordPress 4.0 or higher.\n"

msgid ""
"We solved a problem where self-hosted sites would crash while trying to upload media without an Internet connection. Big yikes, but big fix.\n"
"\n"
"Speaking of media, we know you might have given the app limited access to your media library. No big deal, but we added a prompt to the media picker in case you want to change your settings and allow more access. The prompt even comes in dynamic type for easy reading.\n"
"\n"
"We also made voiceover and dynamic type more accurate on Activity Log and Schedule Post calendars. We’re happy to report that this improves the user experience for folks who need better visual accessibility.\n"
"\n"
"Big news for Comments: you can now follow a conversation using a button in the Comments header and moderate individual comments through a drop-down menu.\n"
"\n"
"We made some useful updates to the Block Editor.\n"
"\n"
"- We solved an issue where buttons weren’t justifying left, right, or center in the Buttons block.\n"
"- We added translation for color settings in Cover blocks.\n"
"- Selecting an image will no longer show you a video thumbnail, and vice versa.\n"
"- We hid the help button in the bottom right of the unsupported block editor to avoid confusion.\n"
"- When you’re using different text and background colors in text blocks, you’ll get a notification if the color combo might make it hard for some people to read.\n"
"- We fixed a handful of edge case problems when changing the color of non-selected text.\n"
"\n"
"We also solved a few smaller issues and crashes.\n"
"\n"
"- Weekly roundup notifications weren’t always being displayed for all users, but now they are.\n"
"- The username selection screen is no longer loading twice.\n"
"- When you connect your Facebook account to Publicize, you’ll now be logged in successfully.\n"
"- Images with a copyright symbol in the file name will now upload or appear in the Share Sheet properly.\n"
"\n"
"Last but not least, we improved error messages on the login screen for self-hosted websites.\n"
