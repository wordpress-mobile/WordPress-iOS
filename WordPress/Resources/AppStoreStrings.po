"WordPress for iOS is an Open Source project, which means you too can contribute to its development. Learn more at https://apps.wordpress.com/contribute/.\n"

"Good news, everyone—we fixed app crashes caused by uploading images while offline, deleting media, or seeing details for \"Like\" notifications.\n"
"\n"
"We made some big changes to the block editor so you can keep calm and publish on:\n"
"\n"
"- When you open the settings for a Button or Image block linked to a URL, the editor won't auto-populate a URL from your clipboard anymore. You'll now see a \"Link To\" suggestion so you can use the clipboard URL or enter a different one.\n"
"- Create a Gallery block and your device's media options will automatically open, making it easier for you to add your images.\n"
"- Adding a new block? If your device is set to a language other than English, the tabs in the inserter menu will now match your set language.\n"
"- When you're using the Embed block, you won't see the \"Edit\" action in the toolbar. You can now change the URL by going into Block Settings instead.\n"
"- In the post editor, switching from HTML mode to Visual mode will bring up a compact notice telling you about the switch.\n"
"- You might have noticed your font size changing on its own in Media and Text blocks. We squashed the bug that was causing it.\n"
"\n"
"New to WordPress? Not to worry. Our login process makes it easier than ever to create and start managing your site.\n"
"\n"
"We also added a new About screen so you can rate and share the app (hint, hint), visit our Twitter profile and blog, view our other apps, and more.\n"
