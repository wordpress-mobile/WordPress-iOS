"• You can filter your Notifications by type: Comments, Likes, Reblogs, all tidied up!"
"• Our reader was sometimes over looking bunches of new posts in your feeds so we took it to get a new pair of reading glasses. Starting in this release it’ll spot those missing posts and give you the option to fetch them."
"• You can now update many of your WordPress.com site settings right inside the App."
"• As much as we love emoji, occasionally seeing a giant smiley staring at us in a featured image was getting kinda creepy. Giant emoji has been served a cease-and-desist order as far as featured images are concerned."
"• We’ve fixed a few layout bugs in iOS 9 which were causing tables to look… a wee bit ugly. They’re much prettier now."
