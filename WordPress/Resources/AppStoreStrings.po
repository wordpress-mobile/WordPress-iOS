"Take a peek at what’s new in this release:\n"
"\n"
"- Support for full-width and wide alignment for the Group, Cover, and Image blocks (with support for more blocks to come).\n"
"- Love rounded corners on your images? We’ve also added support for the Rounded style in the Image block.\n"
"- Some people may have experienced a misbehaving toolbar when adding a new block, but we’ve fixed this issue.\n"
"- We also noticed that in Image Preview, images were not positioned correctly after changing device orientation, but this has been addressed, too.\n"
"- We resolved a few other issues around signup and login, including a username display issue after signing up with Apple, and an incorrect error message that displayed when you reach a maximum number of failed login attempts.\n"
