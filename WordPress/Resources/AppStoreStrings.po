"New year, new look! We updated comment threads with a shiny new design for author labels, accessory and share buttons, and row and reply highlighting. We also made a few updates to the Block Editor.\n"
"\n"
"- When you’re editing Paragraph blocks, you can highlight specific text in any color you’d like.\n"
"- Brand-new Gallery blocks will default to the new design. You can also auto-convert any old galleries to the new format without a hitch.\n"
"- The editor now auto-scrolls, so you can always see what you’re typing. No more disappearing text, no more guesswork.\n"
"- You’ll now see a Comments snippet displayed after your post content in the Reader. This gives you a quick sample of any comments you’ve received and helps you join the conversation faster.\n"
"- We squashed a bug where the background color wasn’t showing up for pre-formatted blocks on sites that use standard themes.\n"
