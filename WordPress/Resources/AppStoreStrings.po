"stroll for the week’s photo challenge at The Daily Post. Respond to your "
"latest comments, or monitor your stats to see where today’s readers are "
"coming from.\n"
"Don’t forget to tag your posts published from the app with #wponthego so the "
"community can find your masterpieces on the move.\n"
