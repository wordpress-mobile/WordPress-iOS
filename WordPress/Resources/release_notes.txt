When you tap on a nested text block, you can immediately edit content in that block—no more tapping through every nesting level to get where you want to go. (Our fingers were getting tired, too.)

We also fixed a bug where the app would crash if you tried to upload media to a classic block without giving WordPress access to your device’s media library. Instead, you’ll see a prompt asking for media access. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
