We’re pleased to announce some exciting changes to the WordPress mobile app. When you create a site, you’ll have the option to pick a homepage design right away. We’ve also made it easier to set the dimensions of cover images and columns, and the Button and Social Icon blocks now have a link picker. We fixed bugs we know were—yes—bugging you, including one where @-mentions weren’t working on WP.com sites with plugins enabled, and another where “tel:” and “mailto:” links on contact pages weren’t launching properly.
