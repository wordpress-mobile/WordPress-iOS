You can now cancel a WordPress.com login while you’re already logged in to a self-hosted site—no more getting stuck on the login screen if you change your mind.

We also squashed several bugs in this latest update.

- Once upon a time, we fixed an issue where deleting one image in a Story Post draft would prevent the next image in the story from loading. And everyone lived happily ever after.
- On iPad displays, the “Turn on notifications” button no longer sits overtop the instructions for turning on push notifications. The “No result” side menu text now fits on screen, too.
- Content above the Powered by Jetpack banner now stays visible and responsive while you’re scrolling. Up, up, and away.
