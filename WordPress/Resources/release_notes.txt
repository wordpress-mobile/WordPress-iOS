What’s new in this update?

Keep up-to-date on any sites you’ve recently been added to by pulling down to refresh on the New Sites screen.

On sites with more than one author, you’ll now be able to switch the author assigned to any Post or Page.

You can now authenticate login requests while you're using the app.

Finally, we fixed a bug with the Quick Start tour. When you follow a site from the reader, the Quick Start checklist will now update your progress (instead of remaining unchecked.)
