v15.3 includes three great changes:

- All blocks now have copy, cut, paste, and duplicate options.
- You can individually edit unsupported blocks on a separate screen in the app, using the same tools available the full web editor. (Note: this isn’t yet available for self-hosted sites, or that sites that default to the classic editor.)
- Ghost Effect! It’s a nice visual touch we added to the editor that displays shaded areas to let you know when and where content is loading.
