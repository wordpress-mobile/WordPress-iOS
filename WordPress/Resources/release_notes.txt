- We know that your website is a passion project and you never really look at your stats because they’re totally not important. But just in case, we added a Today widget you can use to display all-time stats.
- The block editor has more goodies: you’ll find a Gallery block for making multi-image galleries from files in your Media Library, and there’s support for block-specific settings in the List and Video blocks.
- It’s also got one fewer baddie: if your app ever crashed after you opened some block settings and then rotated your device, you’ve now had that experience for the last time.
- And last but not least, sometimes you’d take the “Follow other sites” tour, but the tour wouldn’t be marked off as “Complete.” We never meant to deprive anyone of one of life’s greatest satisfactions, that of crossing a finished item off a list, so this is fixed.
