    If you only want to use Lookback in builds sent to testers (e g by using the
    CocoaPods :configurations=> feature), you need to avoid both linking with
    Lookback.framework and calling any Lookback code (since that would create
    a linker error). By making your calls to LookbackSettingsViewController_Weak
    instead of @link LookbackSettingsViewController @/link, your calls will be disabled when not
    linking with Lookback, and you thus avoid linker errors.

    @example <pre>
        [LookbackSettingsViewController_Weak settingsViewControllerForInstance:[LookbackRecorder sharedRecorder]];
    </pre>
