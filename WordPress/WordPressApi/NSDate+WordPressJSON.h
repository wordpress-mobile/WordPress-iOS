/**
 Parses a date string

 Dates in the format specified in http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime should be OK.
 The kind of dates returned by the REST API should match that format, even if the doc promises ISO 8601.

 Parsing the full ISO 8601, or even RFC 3339 is more complex than this, and makes no sense right now.
 @warning this method doesn't support fractional seconds or dates with leap seconds (23:59:60 turns into 23:59:00)
