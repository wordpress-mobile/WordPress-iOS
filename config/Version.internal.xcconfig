VERSION_SHORT=18.5

// Internal long version example: VERSION_LONG=9.9.0.20180423
//
// Technically, the date for this version was 10/01, but this is the second
// build for the day so I bumped it to 10/02. On 10/04 we'll code freeze 18.4
// and this should be the very last build for 18.3, so we should be fine.
