# Using VoiceOver

## Prepare for VoiceOver:
You can set up an easy short-cut to access VoiceOver from anywhere. Go to:
- iOS Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Accessibility Shortcut -> Select VoiceOver.
- Now you can triple click the side button (on iPhone X series) or the home button (on devices with home button) to turn on and off VoiceOver.

## Using VoiceOver:
- When VoiceOver is ON, the system will highlight and read an accessibility element on the screen. It could be a Button, Label, whole View, etc…
- Slide with one finger across the screen until you find the element you want to activate. The OS will read every element that you finger touches.
- When you find the element you want to perform an action on, double tap with one finger anywhere on the screen to perform that action. If it‘s a button, it will be pressed, if it‘s a switch, it will be flipped, etc…
- If you need to scroll a table, you need to select any element inside that table and scroll with three fingers.
- If you want to close/go back from whenever you are in an app, you can draw a Z shape with two fingers. This is specially helpful for modals with not easy way to be closed.
- For the iPhone X family, the swipe from bottom of the screen gesture is different. When you start dragging, you will hear a little sound, then you need to continue dragging until you hear another sound. The speed is not important, it can be slow.
- You can stop VoiceOver any time by triple clicking the side/home button again and unchecking VoiceOver.
