Dear reader, we’ve added a new look and feel for content navigation and filtering. Now when you’re looking for posts to read, you can find the best and ignore the rest.

We fixed an issue that made images and other media blink away while being uploaded. Presto, no more disappearing act.

Finally, we added new Site Monitoring menu items—including metrics, PHP logs, and web server logs—so you can keep a closer eye on your website. (Don’t worry, it’s not going anywhere.)
