We made some changes to user mentions. When you reply to a post or comment and tag another user, your list of suggested users will begin with names that start with your search query. The list will then continue alphabetically after that.
We also fixed a problem where the list of suggested users would vanish after expanding or collapsing the field for reply content. Presto, no more disappearing act.
