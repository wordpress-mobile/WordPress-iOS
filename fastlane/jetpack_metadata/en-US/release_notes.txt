Made a New Year's resolution to publish more content on your site? We made a few updates to the Block Editor to help you do just that.

- When you're editing Paragraph blocks, you can highlight specific text in any color you'd like.
- Brand-new Gallery blocks will default to the new design. You can also auto-convert any old galleries to the new format without a hitch.
- The editor now auto-scrolls, so you can always see what you're typing. No more disappearing text, no more guesswork.
- We squashed a bug where the background color wasn't showing up for pre-formatted blocks on sites that use standard themes.
