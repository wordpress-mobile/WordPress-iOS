We added a Domain Focus card to your dashboard so you can more easily transfer Google domains. (Don’t want to see this card across multiple sites? Tap the “More” button to hide it.)

We hebben ook enkele belangrijke wijzigingen aangebracht in de blokeditor.

- The Social Link block now includes an outline so you can see when it’s selected.
- We fixed an issue for iOS users where custom font sizes and styles weren’t displaying properly.
- The undo and redo buttons are no longer visible in the HTML editor.
- You’ll now see hex codes for the selected color when you’re using the Cover Block color picker.

Finally, we squashed a bug that could cause the app to crash when following new sites in the Reader.
