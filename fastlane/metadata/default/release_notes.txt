We’ve introduced a fix that prevents certain bugs within the editor and individual block types. This fix logs any bugs that sneak through so we can squash those, too.
We also improved your previewing and publishing experience by removing the edit button from the “Post Published” success screen and the publish button from the “Preview” screen. All in a day’s work.
