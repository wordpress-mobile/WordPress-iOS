We removed a bug in devices running iOS 16 or later, where typing in the block editor while dictating caused the dictated text to be lost. Phew.

Locked and loaded—there’s now a lock icon for disabled cells in the block editor so you know when they aren’t in use.

Finally, we updated the placeholder text for VideoPress videos that don’t belong to your site. (Hopefully they don’t feel left out.)
