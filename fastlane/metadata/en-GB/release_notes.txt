We made a few changes to the block editor.

– The app won’t crash anymore when the editor auto-scrolls down to a block.
– You’ll now see an error message when a video fails to upload to media and text blocks.
– Images no longer appear partly transparent while they’re being uploaded. All colour, all the time.
