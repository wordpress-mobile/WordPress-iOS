– Stay informed! You can now receive a weekly summary of the activity on your most popular sites.

– You have even more control of your site comments – when you edit them you can now also adjust the author’s name, email address, and web address.
We have made a couple of handy tweaks to the Block editor. The Embed block now gives you a sneak preview when you add something from YouTube or Twitter (more providers to come). Also, when you go to insert a block and nothing is found, there is now a no results view.

– If you go to Post Settings > Post Format, you will find the “Standard” option still at the top, but the other options are now neatly alphabetised below. (Options will vary with themes!)

– And one more quick one: refreshing your site is now super easy – just pull to refresh from the My Site screen!
