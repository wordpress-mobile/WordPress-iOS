We made a small but mighty change to the block editor: the “Add Block” button is more visible when you first open the editor with no blocks selected. We also removed one of three error notifications when a media or audio block fails to upload—it felt like overkill.

You’ll hear some accessibility tweaks in the VoiceOver experience when you’re rearranging menu items. Instructions and notices are clearer, and the menu hierarchy makes more sense out loud.

Web previews won’t cut off bottom-of-the-screen notifications when your browser toolbar is visible.

What’s in a name? Well, if your site has one, you’ll see it in the My Site navigation title.

When you swipe left on a comment in your Notifications, you won’t see the “Bin” option anymore. Instead you’ll see “Unapprove Comment” and “Approve Comment.” We approve.
