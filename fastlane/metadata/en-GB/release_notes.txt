This month we have lots of visual fixes, and one new experimental feature we'd love your feedback on.

Visually, we've:
– Updated the site picker to be simpler and easier to use – it adds support for context menus and previews.
– Fixed an issue where some navigation bars in the app were transparent.
– Updated dozens of screens to avoid visual bugs by simplifying the code.

Under "App Settings", you can now try out Application Passwords – a new experimental feature for self-hosted sites that allows them to work with the apps if they use 2FA or SSO.
