Here are highlights from this release:

Jetpack Backup is now available! Depending on your site’s current plan, you can now restore your site or download a backup of your site from a specific moment in time. If you’ve enabled Jetpack Scan, you’ll now be able to scan your site for threats – and fix or ignore them as you wish.

Love keeping track of your stats? We’ve added support for new All Time Widgets, which display your site’s All Time stats on the Home Screen of your iOS 14 device.

You can now set anchors in the Heading block to create page jumps in your content. We’ve made other updates, like improvements to Reusable blocks and blocks you insert just once in your posts, like the More block.

Creating a site on the app keeps getting better. When building a homepage, you can preview how a design looks on a mobile, tablet, or desktop screen. You can also now choose a .blog subdomain for your site.

Finally, we continue to improve the experience in your Reader, and you can now mark posts as “seen” as well as view your total of “unseen” posts.
