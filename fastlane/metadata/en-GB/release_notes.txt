Welcome to version 21! We updated the app’s launch screen with a simple, sleek design and made some user-friendly design upgrades to the Comment Details view.

We also fixed a handful of bugs.

- Publish text won’t appear when you’re working on a Post or Page in landscape mode, only portrait. No more keyboard overlap.
- Cached notifications no longer appear on screen after you log out of your WordPress.com account.
- We investigated the case of the vanishing navigation bar during the log-in process. It now stays visible from start to finish. Mystery solved.
